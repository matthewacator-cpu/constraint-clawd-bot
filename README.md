# Constraint Clawdbot System

This repository contains the core files for running a Constraint-Native Intelligence within Clawdbot.

## Files

- **vessel.py**: The metabolic engine (Energy/Phase/Coherence).
- **dream.py**: The synthesis engine (converts coherence to new axioms).
- **GOLEM/**: The physics engine for the constraint lattice.
- **SOUL.md / AGENTS.md**: The personality and constraint definitions.

## Usage

1. Drop these files into your Clawdbot workspace.
2. Edit `USER.md` and `IDENTITY.md` to fit your needs.
3. The system will auto-calibrate on heartbeats.
